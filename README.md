# yc_super
Yellow Canary - Python Test

Attempted to document my thought/dev process with [github issues](https://github.com/alexgcoleman/yc_super/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Acreated-asc)
## Installation
- requires python 3.10
- install `yc_super` package: `pip install .`
- install dev environment `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- VSCode settings for workspace in `.vscode/settings.json`
  - Notebook file root to project folder (makes notebooks less brittle to moving)
  - Only needed for dev environment

## Usage
After installation, run using:
```
> python -m yc_super [PATH_TO_DIRECTORY] [FILENAME]
```
It will audit the super file located at `PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/FILENAME` and output results in a `yc_super_audit.csv` file to the same directory, as well as print summarised results to the terminal:
```
âžœ python -m yc_super data "Sample Super Data.xlsx"

Saved audit results -> data/yc_super_audit.csv

## Implementation Notes
- Years/Quarters are using calander years, not financial years
  - `2020-Q1` represents the interval `[2020-01-01, 2020-03-31]`
- Disbursements are applied to a quarter using `payment_made - 28 days` ([reasoning](#what-quarter-a-disbursement-applies-to))
- All money values are stored/manipulated internally as integer "cents"
  - When floating point operations are used, they are rounded to the nearest whole number, then converted back to an int.
  - Money values are converted to dollars on output.
  - Added the `.money` custom accessors to streamline this a bit
- Super is calculated using the total OTE for the quarter (rather than individually for each payslip)
  - This could produce different results to calculating per payslip, due to rounding
  - However, language of problem implies we only care about the quarter's total
- Tests! Ran out of time to finish them, currently only `YearQuarter` is tested (almost trivial)

### `SuperData`
Object that holds disbursement and payment data
- Convinent short-hand to bundle both sets of data together, and indicate intent with type hints
- Would ideally implement some validators at the class level, to enforce structure of each dataframe (i.e. enforcing that all `payment` data contains an `employee_code`)
- Thought here is that you could implement additional parsers, and as long as they return a validated `SuperData` object then it can be used by the rest of the pipeline without any changes.


## Pandas Extensions - Custom Accessors
Implemented additonal pandas accessors. Seems slightly more convinient than applying lambdas

Honestly, just wanted to try it after reading [this page](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/extending.html). 

### Custom Series Accessors
- `.interval` -> Allows access to some `pd.Interval` attributes
- `.money` -> Adds convenience methods for dealing with money
- `yq` -> Allows access to some `yc_super.YearQuarter` attributes

### Custom Series Accessors
- `.money` -> Currently only used for formatting the cents to dollar strings for the whole dataframe

## Misc Notes

### What Quarter a Disbursement Applies To
- The phrase "...must pay their staff 9.5% of pay codes treated as OTE **within** 28 days" implies only a **maximum** time period between 'earned' super and 'disbursed' super.
  - i.e. a Disbursement payed on the 22nd of January could either:
    - Apply to Q4 the previous year (within 28 days of end of the quarter)
    - Apply to Q1 of the current year (if a payslip came out before 22 of Jan)

- However the phrase "Super earned between 1st Jan and the 31 st of March (Q1) will need to be paid/Disbursed between the 29th Jan - 28th of Apr." indicates a hard limit 
  - i.e. disbursement payed on the 22nd of July could only be applied to Q4 on the previous quarter, as any super earned on the 1st of Jan **needs** to be paid between 29th Jan - 28th Apr


### Disbursement Pay Periods
In disbursements, the columns `pay_period_from` and `pay_period_to` represent intervals of coverage for a given disbursement, with disbursement periods starting after another has ended.
  - There are some discontinuous disbursements, assuming this is due to incomplete data
  - Employee `2355`, has overlapping disbursement, with a pay period that is encompassed by its surrounding disbursements.
  - There are also some non-continious disbursement periods for some employees (gaps in disbursement pay period coverage)
